# OpenDock secure Windows VM runtime

Native Windows x64 runtime, built September 2026. No host TPM passthrough,
simulator control socket, private signing key, or Windows requirement bypass.

EDK2 submodules are fixed by that commit. `scripts/build-secure-runtime.ps1`
and its referenced shell scripts are the build instructions. Patches are
under `runtime/security/`. Preserve these sources with binary releases.
The firmware configuration disables the interactive shell and network boot,
and uses QEMU's authenticated variable service without requiring SMM.
The existing OpenDock `runtime/gpu/egl-bridge.c` is also built for this runtime
to preserve explicit adapter selection; the complete upstream ANGLE DLL is
kept separately as `libEGL_angle.dll`.

The TPM glue replaces the reference test simulator's entropy and NV-storage
platform, uses Windows BCryptGenRandom, and loads as a private QEMU DLL.
The guest uses the TPM 2.0 TIS interface. The QEMU patch page-aligns and zeros
the PPI backing mapping for WHPX; its guest-visible ACPI interface is unchanged.
CRB's sub-page command RAM is not used with WHPX.
The reboot patch adapts Mohamed Mediouni's [WHPX partition reset proposal](https://patchew.org/QEMU/20260421205749.55060-1-mohamed@unpredictable.fr/),
with error checking. It resets hypervisor interrupt/partition state before
restoring vCPU registers, without replacing the QEMU process or guest disks.
The optional Windows API is unavailable on Windows 10 hosts; that host's reboot
behavior is not certified by the Windows 11 regression test.
`edk2-svsm-probe.patch` requires SEV-SNP before the VirtMmCommunication driver
examines SNP secrets/SVSM metadata. Ordinary guest RAM survives a warm reset;
Windows PE had left nonzero data there, causing a false SVSM detection and an
invalid VMGEXIT instruction on this Intel/WHPX host. The patch keeps the
authenticated QEMU variable service, TPM identity, and Secure Boot enforcement.
OpenSSL conversion uses public APIs rather than the upstream private BIGNUM
layout. Unimplemented ACT timers are disabled. TPM live migration is blocked.
This is a software TPM, not a certified or physically tamper-resistant module.

Shared libraries are unmodified MSYS2 UCRT64 packages. `PACKAGES.txt` records
their exact versions, upstream URLs, licenses and package build jobs. Their
packaging recipes and patches are at https://github.com/msys2/MINGW-packages;
source/package archives are available through https://packages.msys2.org/.
`licenses/` includes the toolchain's upstream license notices (including some
build-only tool notices) plus the missing p11-kit 0.26.5 notices obtained from
https://github.com/p11-glue/p11-kit/tree/0.26.5 and GNU LGPL v3 from
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.txt. Compiler/build tools are not bundled.

`virt-firmware` 25.7 (https://gitlab.com/kraxel/virt-firmware) generates the
initial JSON variable store. It includes public Microsoft 2011/2023 trust
certificates, a generated public platform certificate, the Microsoft DBX,
and the Authenticode hash of exactly OpenDock's installer bootstrap. The
temporary platform private key is neither saved nor distributed.

The binary manifest covers the native binaries, firmware, public-variable
template, dependencies and notices. Source builds are version-pinned, but are
not claimed byte-identical: compiler versions, firmware timestamps and the
generated public platform certificate can differ. Existing VMs pin their
firmware digest; preserve the previous runtime when rebuilding/upgrading.
