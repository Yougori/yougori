# Offline storage expansion tools

The initramfs carries an unmodified `resize2fs` 1.47.4 executable and only its
required libraries (`libe2p`, `libext2fs`, `libcom_err`, musl loader/libc).
These are isolated in `/usr/local/lib/opendock-storage`; no host filesystem
tools or host disks are exposed to the guest.

Packages are authenticated by Alpine's signed APK index. Build inputs are
recorded in BUILD-PACKAGES.txt; most packages listed there are build-root-only
and are NOT shipped in this private helper directory.
