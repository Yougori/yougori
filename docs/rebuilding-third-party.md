# Rebuilding the bundled runtime

The source bundle accompanies a particular runtime inventory. Start with its
`SOURCE_INDEX.json` and `SHA256SUMS`. Do not replace a recorded version with a
nearby upstream release. The index identifies each archive, checksum, recipe,
upstream revision and submodule location. Binaries built with another compiler
or build timestamp need not be byte-identical to exercise their license rights.

## Restore the preferred source

Obtain every archive listed in the source index. Extract the local build-material
archive to read these instructions and the restore utility. With Python 3.12+:

```powershell
python scripts/restore-compliance-sources.py C:/sources/bundle C:/yougori-rebuild
```

The destination must be new. The utility verifies SHA-256 before extracting the
upstream trees, local source/build scripts and submodules at their original
paths. It does not use Git or download missing source. Unix preserves source
symlinks directly; Windows may require Developer Mode for those links.
Keep the untouched archives separately when making modifications.
The unused EDK2 macOS emulator link to `/opt/X11/include` is recorded in the
receipt and left uncreated. Its original entry remains in the source archive.

## Windows QEMU, TPM and firmware

Use an MSYS2 UCRT64 development shell, with the development packages listed in
`runtime/security/README.md`. Exact package versions and their build dependencies
are recorded in the source bundle's MSYS `.BUILDINFO` files and runtime
`PACKAGES.txt`. The build tools are ordinary compiler/build prerequisites.

From the restored directory in UCRT64, apply the supplied patches once:

```sh
repo="$PWD"
cd build/runtime-cache/qemu-secure-src
for patch_file in qemu-windows-tpm.patch qemu-whpx-tpm-ppi.patch qemu-whpx-reboot.patch qemu-license-notices.patch; do
  patch -p1 < "$repo/runtime/security/$patch_file"
done
cp "$repo/runtime/security/tpm-qemu.c" "$repo/runtime/security/tpm-api.h" backends/tpm/
cd "$repo/build/runtime-cache/ms-tpm-20-ref"
patch -p1 < "$repo/runtime/security/ms-tpm-openssl3.patch"
cd "$repo/build/runtime-cache/edk2-secure-src"
patch -p1 < "$repo/runtime/security/edk2-svsm-probe.patch"
cd "$repo"
YOUGORI_QEMU_BUILD_TOOLS=1 bash scripts/build-secure-qemu.sh
bash scripts/build-tpm-library.sh
```

These low-level build scripts accept exported source trees without `.git`.
The final QEMU patch adds dated modification notices to the ten changed upstream
files. It changes comments only. The earlier functional patch bytes and the
existing binaries' `SOURCE_BUILD.json` records are retained as original build
evidence; `compliance/evidence/qemu-modification-notices.json` records the
supplementary source annotation and verifies equivalence after removing only
those notices. New builds also record the notice patch in their build inputs.
The PowerShell source-fetching wrapper is for normal Git development checkouts.
QEMU uses the recorded WHPX/TCG, VNC, OpenGL and GnuTLS profile; JACK and the
unused remote-disk/UI backends are disabled. The TPM worker is a separate
BSD-licensed process. It retains the same NV format and uses anonymous pipes.

The stock PC firmware files are byte-matched to `pc-bios/` at the recorded QEMU
revision. The EDK2 `.bz2` files are decompressed when staging. Their source trees
are restored under `roms/`; use `roms/Makefile`, `config.seabios*`,
`edk2-build.py` and `edk2-build.config` for the matching build configurations.

The custom Secure Boot firmware uses the separate `edk2-secure-src` tree. In
WSL/Linux, install the developer prerequisites from the security README, then:

```sh
bash scripts/build-secure-firmware.sh
```

`scripts/build-secure-vars.sh` documents how to generate a new public trust
template using pinned virt-firmware tooling. The boot helper's complete source
and MSVC build command are in `src-tauri/boot-helper/`. No host firmware key is
needed. Public Microsoft trust objects retain their component license.

## Windows ANGLE graphics

The Windows runtimes use ANGLE revision
`890b5d8fa2988e3719e0d80421bf3e927db9cd5c` with only D3D11 enabled.
The original MSYS2 package DLLs also incorporate optional Vulkan/SPIRV
implementations and are not substitutes for this profile.

Restore `msys-mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-angleproject-2.1.r25748.890b5d8f-6.tar.gz`
from the indexed source bundle. Its `recipe/` and `distfiles/` directories are
the `--inputs` directory below. The build script is in the local source-material
archive, alongside `runtime/gpu/angle-d3d11.gn` and the component notices.
Use Windows, Python 3.12+ and an MSYS2 UCRT64 toolchain with GCC, GN, Ninja,
Python, pkgconf, patch and zlib development files. The exact versions used for
the shipped DLLs are recorded in `ANGLE_BUILD.json` under `toolchainPackages`.

```powershell
python scripts/build-angle-runtime.py --inputs C:/rebuild/angle-sources --source-index C:/rebuild/bundle/SOURCE_INDEX.json --msys C:/msys64
python scripts/test-angle-runtime.py --angle build/angle-runtime/angle/out/Yougori-D3D11 --output build/angle-runtime/gpu-smoke.json
```

The default paths work with this project's compliance cache and local toolchain.
Build work stays under `build/angle-runtime`; existing runtime files are preserved.
All recipe input digests are checked before extraction. The script restores the
ANGLE, Chromium build/clang/zlib and SPIRV header/tool source inputs and applies
the retained portability patches. GN parses unused SPIRV targets, but the
requested DLL targets do not compile or link them. Build arguments explicitly
disable Vulkan, SwiftShader, OpenGL, D3D9, WGPU, ASTC encoding, frame capture and
the overlay. D3D11 and HLSL translation remain available.

The inspector follows the requested targets and records the compiler's actual
header dependencies, source hashes and commands. It rejects excluded native
implementations and unreviewed source license declarations, and preprocesses
the font source to verify that glyph data is absent. API-only Khronos headers,
Bison/Flex output permissions, Chromium helpers, xxHash and compiler runtime
exceptions have explicit decisions and notice texts. This is not a blanket
assumption that ANGLE's package-level BSD label covers everything it contains.

The outputs are `libEGL.dll`, `libGLESv2.dll`, `ANGLE_BUILD.json` and
`ANGLE-NOTICES.txt`. Both Windows staging scripts accept `-AngleDirectory` and
verify those identities before copying. The graphics bridge keeps the rebuilt
EGL library as `libEGL_angle.dll`. A new build requires inspection and review
before updating the pinned build digest in `compliance/native.json`.
Recipients may make their own changes and update editable manifests; these
project release checks do not restrict the licenses' modification permissions.

## Linux packages and libraries

Each `alpine-*.tar.gz` contains an exact aports recipe directory, configuration
files, patches and SHA-512-verified distfiles for the packages in the appliance.
This includes the Linux kernel, BusyBox and storage utilities. In an Alpine
3.24 x86_64 build environment, use the provided APKBUILD with Alpine's `abuild`
tools and place the supplied distfiles in the configured `SRCDEST`. Build
dependencies are declared in the recipe. Aports package signing for your own
builds uses your own key; it does not require Yougori's keys.

The MSYS archives contain their original `.BUILDINFO`, `.PKGINFO`, recipe files
and verified source inputs. They cover the shared libraries bundled beside
QEMU. ANGLE uses the specific profile above. For the other packages, use MSYS2's normal `makepkg-mingw` build procedure with those inputs and
the recorded UCRT64 architecture. For a `git+...#commit=...` input, the supplied
tar is the exact `git archive` content used by makepkg's source checksum.
Unpack it at the recipe's named source location; use the recorded prepare/build
steps when working without a Git clone. Generated-source steps remain in the
recipe. Source signatures are supplementary; payload checksums are mandatory.

For GMP, Nettle and libunistring, this QEMU distribution uses the libraries'
GPL-2.0-or-later option. Their original license declarations and the GPLv2 text
are retained in `RUNTIME_LICENSES.txt`; other files keep their own terms.
The zlib PR patch is retained with the exact recipe checksum. GitHub's generated
patch had changed only its abbreviated blob-ID width; the collector recovered
the original bytes and verified the full original checksum.

The OCI source archives match the VCS revisions embedded in containerd, nerdctl,
runc and CNI. Their dependency ZIPs match the binaries' Go `h1:` checksums. Keep
their own Makefiles, vendor/generated sources and license files. The local agent
source is in `appliance/agent/`; its `go.mod`/`go.sum` and the build scripts specify
its inputs. The static mount helper was rebuilt byte-for-byte with Ubuntu's
musl 1.2.2-4; its complete musl copyright notice is also supplied.

The Debian source archives cover glibc 2.41-12+deb13u3, libseccomp 2.6.0-2 and
libbtrfs from btrfs-progs 6.14-1, used by the static OCI builds. Each contains
the `.dsc`, original source, Debian patches and build rules. Use `dpkg-source
-x` on the `.dsc` in a Debian 13 build environment, install the declared build
dependencies, then `dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -b`. The supplied runc/containerd
source can be relinked against modified libraries using nerdctl's original
Dockerfile build stages. `oci-build-provenance.tar.gz` retains the release log
and the digest-checked build-base image attestations that identify these versions.

`scripts/build-appliance.sh` assembles the guest filesystem. Its ordinary online
package selection can change as Alpine updates; rebuilding this exact package
set requires the versions in `compliance/evidence/alpine-packages.json` and the
provided package recipes. Use a disposable build environment, not a user disk.

## Installing modified components

You may modify/rebuild the separately licensed components, replace their DLLs,
and debug those modifications under their applicable licenses. Yougori's license
adds no restriction on reverse engineering needed to debug an LGPL component.

Close the affected VMs, retain their disks/security state, and put the replacement
runtime in your own Yougori build's `src-tauri/resources/runtime/` directory.
Recompute that directory's `SHA256SUMS` over its files, excluding the manifest
itself. This is an editable integrity manifest, not a vendor signature lock.
Build your Yougori copy with the source build commands in the repository README.

Firmware hashes are also pinned in existing VM profiles to protect measured
boot. Test modified firmware in a new disposable VM first. The complete profile
format and runtime source are available for deliberate migration of existing
VMs. Changing firmware can require a guest BitLocker recovery key. Existing
identities must not be deleted or silently regenerated. No Yougori private
signing key is required to build or run modified components.
